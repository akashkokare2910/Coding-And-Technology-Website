                <p class="card-text">Flying taxis" will start taking off from an aerodrome north of Paris as soon as next June, in a trial of a vast tourist influx for the 2024 Olympics. A drone-like, fully-electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (VTOL) dubbed VoloCity, produced by German company Volocopter, was chosen for the innovative trial with flying taxis in a peri-urban area, they said. VoloCity is equipped with 18 rotors and nine battery packs. Each can carry two passengers with hand luggage, for a maximum payload of 200 kilogrammes (440 pounds).The partners said in a statement they had decided to bring together all the conditions to make the emergence of this new mode of transport possible to complement the existing modes, whether for the public or for goods. However Permission from residents will be taken first keeping in mind the security protocols said the company. Furthermore, the prospect of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games provides an exceptional opportunity to involve an entire industry in order to make Paris Region a leader in the global market of urban air mobility.

                <small class="text-muted">Published by Programming Lust</small>
                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">Apple applies for a patent on self-healing phone display technology:
Apple Inc. has applied for a patent on a bendable phone that also has self-healing display technology. The company applied for the patent last year and it has just recently been made public. Bendability technology in smartphones is still in its infancy. Those phones that are available have been found to be susceptible to more screen scratches than regular phones. This is due to dirt or other material that gets on the screen which becomes a scratching problem when the phone is bent and especially when folded. Because of that, the major smartphone makers, including Apple, have been looking for a way to make them less easily scratched. One possible solution is to place a layer of material on the screen face that has self-healing capabilities. In this new patent application, Apple has made it clear that the company is looking into the possibility of making and selling a new bendable or foldable phone—the name of the technology it is looking to patent is called "Electronic Devices With Flexible Display Cover Layers."

                <small class="text-muted">Published by Programming Lust </small>
                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">There are many places in this world that are hard for researchers to study, mainly because it's too dangerous for people to get there. Now University of Washington researchers have created a 98 milligram sensor system—about one tenth the weight of a jellybean that can ride aboard a small drone or an insect, until it gets to its destination. Then, when a researcher sends a Bluetooth command, the sensor is released from its perch and can fall up to 72 feet—and land without breaking. Once on the ground, the sensor can collect data, such as temperature or humidity, for almost three years. The team presented this research Sept. 24 at MobiCom 2020.Once a mechanism is developed to recover sensors after their batteries have died, the team expects their system could be used in a wide variety of locations, including environmentally sensitive areas. The researchers plan to replace the battery with a solar cell and automate sensor deployment in industrial settings.
