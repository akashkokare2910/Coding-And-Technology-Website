                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">Taking low-poly grunge as a deliberate design direction, the Droog DM-017 (also known as the E-Fighter V2) was designed to be the kind of e-bike that mirrors the anarchist end-of-the-world vibe this year has been so far. Building on the original E-Fighter, the V2 features an upgraded battery pack and brushless 2020 DS motor by Zero, sitting underneath a faceted distressed-metal body that does a great job of adding character to the bike… a feature that’s only further reinforced by the e-bike’s solid all-terrain wheels.

The E-Fighter V2 also comes with an unusual headlamp that shines through two slits in the front metal panel. 
This linear lighting approach mirrors the Cybertruck’s style, and can even be found on the back with the light-strip taillamps. 
While the aesthetics hint at a combination of futurism and performance, the bike is, in fact, built to live up to those expectations. 
The brushless motor from Zero gives the E-Fighter V2 80 lb-ft of instant torque and a top speed of 100mph. The e-bike even features upgraded suspension in both front and rear wheels, with adjustability on the fly, and a Bluetooth-enabled app that allows you to change parameters as well as monitor your bike’s performance. 
When all’s said and done, you can simply plug the e-bike into a 110V charging point to juice it up overnight… that’s if there is a functioning power-grid in the post-apocalyptic world.

                <h4 class="card-title">Audi Q2, first drive in India.</h4>
                <small class="text-muted">Published by Techblogs</small>
                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">The Audi Q2 is the most accessible offering in the company’s portfolio in India and we spend some time with one to find out the sort of customer it will appeal to and whether it’s worth the high asking price.
VariantModel is Audi Q2 40 TFSI quattro Technology along with Engine having 1,984cc 4-cyl turbo petrol.It has Power of 190bhp@4,200rpm.
Max torque of Audio Q2 is of 320Nm@1,500-4,180rpm.Gearbox is of 7-speed dual having an auto clutch.Wheelbase of the car is of 2,593mm.
It has a Top Speed of228kmph and it an ability to jump from 0-100kmph within 6.5 seconds.
At 4.3 metres long, 1.8 metres wide and around 1.6 metres tall, the Audi Q2 is quite compact and while it might not have the road presence certain buyers look for in SUVs, it looks quite attractive and well proportioned at least to our eyes.
Unlike the cutting edge dashboards we’ve seen in recent Audis with dual-screen, button-free setups, the Q2’s dashboard is much simpler in terms of appearance. 
The layout has a sporty, Audi TT like feel to it with its circular air vents.
While features wise you largely get everything you’d expect from a luxury car in this segment including wireless charging, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, a large sunroof, two-zone climate control, reverse parking camera, front and rear parking sensors to name a few, the lack of powered front seats does seem like a shocking omission especially considering the asking price. 
It ranges between 35-50lakhs in India.
