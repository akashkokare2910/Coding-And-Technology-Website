                <small class="text-muted">Published by Techblogs</small>
                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">Microsoft unveiled a new chip design 18th November,2020 that it says will usher in a new era of security on Windows PCs.
Partnering with chip manufacturing giants Intel, AMD and Qualcomm, Microsoft says a new security component, Pluton, will be constructed directly into the CPU instead of residing on its own in the current Trusted Platform Module. 
The TPM has long been used to store hardware and cryptographic keys.
The technology is based upon a security approach that Microsoft launched nearly a decade ago in Xbox gaming consoles.
The popular gaming system is a rare example of popular product that has been extraordinarily successful in fending off hackers.
 The same principles were applied to Microsoft's internet-of-things service Azure Sphere, which along with Xbox helped the company refine its defense line against intruders.
 "This is a going to be mchbetter, stronger, faster, more consistent said by the officials.
 But,right now no release date has been set for the new processor.

                <h4 class="card-title">Samsung begins mass production of 16Gb LPDDR5 memory chips on world's largest semiconductor line</h4>
                <small class="text-muted">Published by Techblogs</small>
                <hr>
                <p class="card-text">Samsung Electronics has announced that the company has begun mass production of its 16Gb LPDDR5 mobile memory chips on a new production line.
                In its announcement, the company claims that the production process is the first to use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology.
                 In investing so much into their new production facility, the company is also making it clear to consumers and competitors alike that they believe consumers will soon be clamoring for more memory capacity in their mobile devices.
                 The company also notes that the new production line will be used to develop the company's most advanced semiconductor technology, starting with 16Gb LPDDR5 mobile memory chips.
                 Samsung claims the memory chips will have the highest memory performance available today in addition to the largest capacity. 
                 They anticipate a need for such chips as consumers transition to 5G phones which will also have AI capabilities—both of which are expected to grab a lot of memory.
